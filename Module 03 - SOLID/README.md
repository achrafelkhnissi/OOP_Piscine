# Module 03 - SOLID

The development of object-oriented programming began in the 1960s, but it wasn’t until
the 1990s that the concept really began to take hold in the software development industry.
As the complexity of applications and systems increased, developers began to realize that
it was important to create software that could evolve over time without becoming too
difficult to maintain.

It was in this context that the `SOLID` principles were developed. They were proposed by
Robert C. Martin, a software developer and computer consultant, also known as "Uncle
Bob". The principles were formulated to help programmers create software that was
easier to modify, maintain and reuse.

Each letter in the word `SOLID` refers to a specific rule, the meaning of which you will
explore in this module:\
• `S`ingle Responsibility Principle\
• `O`pen/Closed Principle\
• `L`iskov Substitution Principle\
• `I`nterface Segregation Principle\
• `D`ependency Inversion Principle

By following these principles, developers can create more flexible and modular soft-
ware. It also reduces the coupling between different parts of the software, making it
easier to maintain and evolve the code. The `SOLID` principles are therefore an essential
tool for programmers who want to create high-quality, scalable and maintainable software.
